**ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm a 3rd-year Data Science student at Manipal University Jaipur.**

I'm deeply passionate about Data Science and AI/ML, and I'm dedicated to honing my skills in these areas. My tech journey began with mastering programming languages like Python, Java, C, and C++, which provided a strong foundation for my current focus on machine learning and computer vision.

In the world of AI and computer vision, I've worked extensively with tools like OpenCV and YOLO (v5/v8), developing models that can analyze and interpret visual data. From object detection to automating complex tasks, I enjoy the challenge of transforming data into actionable insights.

On the frontend development side, I have experience crafting responsive and interactive user interfaces using HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and Angular. This combination of skills enables me to build web applications that are not only functional but also visually appealing.

**Skillset:**
- **Programming Languages:** Python, Java, C, C++
- **Computer Vision & Machine Learning:** OpenCV, YOLO (v5/v8),python-lib as Pytorch, Scikit-learn, Keras, Pandas, Numpy etc 
- **Frontend Development:** HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, Angular

**ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:** Still diving deeper into AI/ML, Data Science, and frontend development. There's always more to learn, and Iâ€™m excited to keep growing in these areas!

**âš¡ Fun fact:** Iâ€™m a football and book geek. I guess you could say Iâ€™m always looking to score a good read or kick off a new chapterâ€”just don't ask me to choose between a goal and a plot twist!
